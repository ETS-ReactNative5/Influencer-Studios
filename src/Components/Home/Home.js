          â€‹In the heart of Salt Lake, convenient to the airport and within the
          "Devil's Triangle" of freeways (I-15, I-80, I-215) you will find our
          state-of-the-art film and audio production studio ... but only if
          you're looking for it. The older brick exterior in a "historic"
          neighborhood (aka yet-to-be-renovated area) is the perfect disguise to
          prevent the paparazzi from rushing us and stalking our talent. They
          would never suspect that our camouflaged building is an internal
          safe-haven where the magic happens!
          <br />
          <br />
          Shh....
          <br />
          It's a carefully guarded secret that behind this brick (individually
          laid by the building's owner, Angelo, himself while defying all modern
          child-labor laws at the age of 12) we run a covert high-tech operation
          that boasts:
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              The quietest studio in SL, assisted by a nearly half-million
              dollar renovation that includes floor-ceiling surround sound
              panels. We've done the work so you don't have to choose between
              A/C and set lights! (You're welcome, sweat-proned actors. And if
              you're still a little shiny up top, click on our tab for Makeup
              ... yes, men--it's your moment to wear it shamelessly.)
            </li>
            <li>Each room expertly sound-proofed.</li>
            <li>A 1900 sq ft soundstage, 13 ft ceilings</li>
            <li>Full white and green cyc walls with scoops</li>
            <li>Separate audio recording and control rooms</li>
            <li>Sound-proof edit bays</li>
            <li>12'x50' staging and green room area</li>
            <li>Electric grid</li>
            <li>digitally converted sound panel</li>
            <li>Technical control panels</li>
            <li>
              Integrated networking through each room, which can accommodate a
              full orchestra
            </li>

          To the unsuspecting passerby, it is just another building around the
          corner from the haunted house. To those in the know, it is Utah's film
          and audio industry's best-kept secret. Truly a geode. We've got your
          back!
